# About Me
## My interests
* I am focused on getting a Cybersecurity degree.
* I love watching sports, mostly soccer and football.
* I also enjoy playing video games and reading in my spare time.
## Websites I Recommend
* [ESPN](https://espn.com) I think ESPN is a great website because it lets you find sports information about any team, and it also has some great sports documentaries.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com) Twitter is interesting because it lets you view many different events from around the world and what people are saying about them. It also can let you find and join a community you are interested in.
